# Singularity Protocol - Development Status

## DISCOVERED: Fake Validation Tests

**WFA is NOT real walk-forward:**
- Currently: Tests same model on different time windows (instant)
- Should: Re-train NEW model on each fold, then test (slow but real)
- For GP: Must re-evolve new tree on each training window

**Monte Carlo is weak:**
- Currently: Just bootstraps existing trades
- Should: Test strategy robustness with data perturbations

## Next Task: Implement Real Validation

**Plan:**
1. WFA: Create `run_real_walk_forward_analysis()` that:
   - For each fold: re-run GP evolution on training window
   - Test evolved model on test window
   - This will take ~5-10 min per fold (3 folds = 15-30 min total)
   - Worth it for legitimate validation

2. Monte Carlo: Enhance to:
   - Test with price noise injection
   - Test with entry/exit timing perturbations
   - Test with cost variations

3. Add proper logging to show validation is actually running

## Critical Fixes Applied

✅ Data leakage: Removed target_return from GP inputs
✅ Gauntlet thresholds: Made WFA (1.0 Sharpe) and MC (strict AND) more rigorous
✅ GP model loading: Fixed reconstructed_model error

## System Status

- All existing models invalid (trained with leakage)
- Forge running but validation will reject fake-good models
- Implementing real validation before deploying any models
IMPLEMENTING REAL WFA - saves to: documents/CURRENT_STATUS.md

Fixed: Model loading error (duplicate return)

Next: Real WFA in validation_gauntlet.py lines 149-180
- Replace fake loop with re-training on each fold
- Will take 5-10 min per fold (worth it for legitimate validation)


✅ REAL WFA IMPLEMENTED (validation_gauntlet.py lines 153-224)
- Now re-trains GP on each fold (500 pop, 30 gen per fold)
- Tests on truly unseen data
- Takes ~5-10 min per fold (15-30 min total)
- Legitimate walk-forward validation


✅ Fixed Oracle feature mismatch:
- Old oracle trained with 71 features (included target_return)
- New training uses 70 features (target_return removed)
- Deleted models/fitness_oracle.pkl
- Will retrain from scratch with correct features


✅ Fixed agent model loading bug:
- _load_specialist_models() was being called but return value not assigned
- Fixed in crucible_engine.py lines 575 and 692
- Now: self.specialist_models = new_v3_agent._load_specialist_models()
- Agent should now have models available for trading


## Issue: GP only ran 30 gens instead of 100

Checking:
1. task_scheduler.py sets GENERATIONS=100 correctly
2. Passed to StrategySynthesizer correctly
3. But SAE loop ran 30/30

Need to verify self.generations in StrategySynthesizer.__init__

## Issue: WFA unpacking error

synthesizer.run() returns single value (best tree)
WFA tries to unpack 3 values
Fixed in validation_gauntlet.py
