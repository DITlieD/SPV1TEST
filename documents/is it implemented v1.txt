Of course. Here is a detailed, multi-phase to-do list to implement every unimplemented feature from your strategic blueprints and evolve your system into the complete "Ascendant Protocol."

This roadmap prioritizes foundational stability and risk management before layering on more complex alpha-generating components.

***
### Phase 1: High-Fidelity Simulation & Objective Alignment

**Goal:** Ensure the system optimizes for the correct objective in a realistic environment. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite for everything that follows.

* **1. Implement High-Fidelity Backtesting:**
    * **File:** `backtester.py`.
    * **Action:** Upgrade your `vectorbt` backtester to model real-world frictions.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]**Latency:** Ensure trades execute at the **next bar's open price** to simulate signal processing and network delay[cite: 386].
        * **Dynamic Costs:** Implement a dynamic `slippage` parameter. [cite_start]This cost should be a function of volatility (e.g., a fraction of the ATR) and potentially order size relative to volume, modeling the "Square Root Law" of market impact[cite: 389, 391, 407].
        * [cite_start]**Liquidity Constraints:** Cap the maximum trade size as a fraction of the bar's total volume (e.g., `MAX_PARTICIPATION_RATE = 0.10`) to prevent unrealistic fills[cite: 402].

* **2. Align Fitness Function with the Velocity Mandate:**
    * **Files:** `forge/crucible/fitness_function.py`, `elite_tuner.py`.
    * **Action:** Retarget the entire evolutionary engine to maximize **Log Wealth** under strict risk constraints.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Modify the fitness function to return the `log_wealth` from the backtest[cite: 1432, 1438].
        * Implement **pruning constraints** in the Optuna `objective` function. [cite_start]A trial must be immediately pruned (`raise optuna.TrialPruned()`) if it fails to meet minimum thresholds for the number of trades, **Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR)**, or exceeds the **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)** threshold[cite: 1436, 1437].

* **3. Implement Systematic Model Calibration:**
    * **File:** `models_v2.py` (or your model wrappers).
    * **Action:** The Kelly Criterion requires accurate probabilities. [cite_start]Wrap your base models (LGBM, XGBoost) with `sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV` using `method='isotonic'` during the training phase[cite: 1425, 1426, 1427].

### Phase 2: On-Chain Intelligence & Systemic Resilience

**Goal:** Integrate a new, powerful source of domain-specific alpha and build the system's "immune system" to handle anomalies.

* **1. Integrate On-Chain Data:**
    * **New File:** `forge/data_processing/onchain_data_fetcher.py`.
    * [cite_start]**Action:** Create a module to fetch data from a provider like Glassnode or CryptoQuant[cite: 111].
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Focus on **Net Exchange Flows** and **Stablecoin Supply** metrics[cite: 112].
        * [cite_start]In `data_processing_v2.py`, add a step to fetch, clean, and align this data onto the strategic (4H) timeframe, creating momentum and standardized score features[cite: 113, 114].
        * [cite_start]Incorporate these new on-chain features as inputs for the HDBSCAN regime detector and Strategic Bias model[cite: 115].

* **2. Implement the "Immune System" (Anomaly Detection):**
    * [cite_start]**New File:** `forge/monitoring/immune_system.py`[cite: 117].
    * [cite_start]**Action:** Train an **Autoencoder** model on a vector of "normal" system and market data (e.g., API latency, feature values, model uncertainty scores)[cite: 118].
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]In the main trading loop, continuously feed the current state vector to the autoencoder and monitor the **reconstruction error**[cite: 119].
        * [cite_start]If the error spikes above a threshold (indicating an anomaly), trigger a defensive protocol, such as signaling the RL Governor to halt new trades or immediately reduce exposure[cite: 120].

### Phase 3: Relational Dynamics & Probabilistic Modeling

**Goal:** Evolve beyond single-asset analysis by implementing GNNs and integrating the existing (but unused) probabilistic models.

* **1. Implement Graph Neural Network (GNN) Pipeline:**
    * **Action:** Model the entire crypto market as an interconnected graph.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * **`forge/data_processing/graph_builder.py`:** Create a module that constructs a dynamic graph at each time step. [cite_start]Assets are nodes, and edges are weighted by the rolling correlation between them[cite: 85, 87, 88].
        * [cite_start]**`forge/models/gnn_intermarket.py`:** Define a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** model using `torch_geometric`[cite: 84, 89].
        * **Integration:** In your feature factory, pass the graph through the GAT to generate enriched embeddings for each asset. [cite_start]Add these embeddings as powerful new features for your Hydra models[cite: 92].

* **2. Integrate Existing Probabilistic Models:**
    * **Action:** Activate the `BayesianNN` and `MarketStateTracker` (Particle Filter) that are already in the code.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Add `'BayesianNN'` to the `MODEL_ARCHITECTURES` list in `forge/blueprint_factory/genetic_algorithm.py` so the GA can select it[cite: 803].
        * In `feature_factory.py`, use the `MarketStateTracker` to generate a "denoised" close price and an "uncertainty" feature based on particle variance. [cite_start]Feed these as new inputs to all models[cite: 977, 978].

### Phase 4: Causal Inference & Autonomous Strategy Synthesis

**Goal:** Implement the final, most advanced pillars: ensuring new logic is causally robust and automating the discovery of entire trading strategies.

* **1. Implement the Causal Inference Gauntlet:**
    * [cite_start]**New File:** `forge/validation/causal_validator.py`[cite: 94].
    * **Action:** Build a rigorous validation step for all new GP-generated features.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Using `dowhy` and `econml`, create a pipeline that models the causal relationship (Treatment: New Feature, Outcome: Future Returns)[cite: 84, 96, 97].
        * [cite_start]Estimate the feature's effect using **Double Machine Learning (DML)**[cite: 98, 99].
        * **Critically**, try to **refute** the effect using tests like "Placebo Treatment." [cite_start]A feature is only approved if it has a significant causal effect AND passes these refutation tests[cite: 99, 100].

* **2. Implement Autonomous Strategy Synthesis (GP 2.0):**
    * [cite_start]**New File:** `forge/evolution/strategy_synthesizer.py`[cite: 101].
    * **Action:** Upgrade from simple feature discovery to full strategy evolution.
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Using the `deap` library, define a set of primitives including logical operators (`IfThenElse`, `GreaterThan`) and terminals (your entire pool of master features)[cite: 84, 102, 103].
        * Build a GP engine that evolves complete trading strategies as trees.
        * [cite_start]The fitness function will compile each tree into executable logic and evaluate it using the high-fidelity `vectorbt` backtester[cite: 105].
        * [cite_start]Successful, validated strategies are then added as new, unique "species" (models) into the Hydra ensemble pool[cite: 106].

* **3. Implement the AI Analyst:**
    * [cite_start]**New File:** `forge/monitoring/ai_analyst.py`[cite: 121].
    * [cite_start]**Action:** Set up **Ollama** with a local LLM[cite: 84, 121].
    * **Sub-Tasks:**
        * [cite_start]Create prompt templates to translate the evolved GP 2.0 strategy trees and the Causal Gauntlet results into human-readable text[cite: 122].
        * [cite_start]Log the LLM's hypotheses to the dashboard, providing crucial transparency and fulfilling the Human-in-the-Loop governance requirement[cite: 122].
