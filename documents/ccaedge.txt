This is the blueprint for the **Causal Cognition Architecture (CCA)**, a proprietary system designed to achieve a persistent, structural edge in high-velocity trading.

The CCA transcends standard methodologies by synthesizing four cutting-edge concepts into a unified intelligence framework. It is designed to provide dominance by inferring the actions of dominant players, mapping global influences, distilling deep knowledge into explicit strategies, and managing risk through fundamental information theory.

### The Edge: A Unified Causal Intelligence

The CCA provides a multi-layered advantage by integrating:

1.  **Micro-Causality (The Liquidity Lens):** Inferring the internal state and predicting the forced actions of Market Makers (MMs) using microstructure data.
2.  **Macro-Causality (The Influence Map):** Mapping the causal flow of information across the entire market ecosystem (inter-asset influence) to anticipate global shifts.
3.  **Symbiotic Distillation (The Accelerator):** Distilling the complex patterns discovered by Deep Learning (Micro+Macro Causality) into fast, verifiable, explicit trading rules using Genetic Programming.
4.  **Complexity Resonance (The Guardian):** Dynamically adapting strategy complexity and managing risk based on the Algorithmic Complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity) of the market.

### Architecture Blueprint: The Causal Cognition Architecture (CCA)

The CCA integrates four specialized engines into the Singularity Protocol.

#### Engine 1: The Micro-Causality Engine (MCE)

This engine models the behavior of the dominant participants in the MFT environment—the Market Makers.

*   **Objective:** Infer MM inventory skew and predict their forced actions (e.g., inventory flushing).
*   **Data Input:** Real-time L2 Order Book data and Tick data (requires low-latency connection).
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Calculate high-frequency Order Flow Imbalance (OFI), Book Pressure Ratio, and Spread Dynamics.
    *   **Core Model:** A Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) trained to predict the `MM_Inferred_Inventory_Skew` and `MM_Risk_Pressure`. TFTs are ideal for capturing both static covariates (asset type) and time-varying inputs (order flow).

*   **Proprietary Output:** `MCE_Skew`, `MCE_Pressure`.

#### Engine 2: The Macro-Causality Engine (Influence Mapper)

This engine maps the global causal dynamics of information flow across assets.

*   **Objective:** Anticipate volatility and directional movements by understanding how influence propagates through the market network.
*   **Data Input:** Synchronized 1m price/volume data across the entire `ASSET_UNIVERSE`.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Signal Extraction:** Calculate Permutation Entropy (PE) for each asset (a measure of disorder/surprise).
    *   **Causal Mapping:** Use Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) to calculate the Causal Adjacency Matrix—the real-time map of directed influence between assets. TE measures the information transfer from one time series to another.
    *   **Propagation Modeling:** A Graph Attention Network (GATv2) models how entropy signals propagate through the causal map.

*   **Proprietary Output:** `Influence_Incoming` (Causal pressure on the asset), `Influence_Outgoing` (Asset's influence on the market), `Predicted_Entropy_Delta`.

#### Engine 3: The Symbiotic Distillation Engine (SDE)

This engine converts the deep, implicit knowledge from the Causal Engines into explicit trading strategies.

*   **Objective:** Achieve the predictive power of Deep Learning with the speed and verifiability of explicit rules.
*   **Methodology (The Symbiotic Crucible):**
    1.  **The Implicit Brain (The Teacher):** A powerful DNN (e.g., a master TFT) is trained on the combined dataset (Standard MTFA features + MCE outputs + Influence Mapper outputs). It identifies the deepest patterns.
    2.  **Knowledge Distillation:** The trained Implicit Brain generates "soft labels" (probabilities) for the entire dataset.
    3.  **The Explicit Brain (The Student):** The GP 2.0 engine evolves strategies to optimize **Symbiotic Fitness**:
        *   *Symbiotic Fitness = (Mimicry Score) + (PnL Score)*
        *   *Mimicry Score:* How closely the GP strategy matches the Implicit Brain's soft labels (measured via Cross-Entropy).
    *   **Deployment:** Only the explicit GP rule is deployed, ensuring high-speed execution and verifiability.

#### Engine 4: The Kolmogorov Complexity Manager (KCM)

This engine acts as the meta-governor, managing risk and guiding evolution based on Information Theory.

*   **Objective:** Ensure the system adapts to the fundamental predictability of the market.
*   **Methodology (K-Complexity Estimation):**
    *   **Market Complexity Index (MCI):** Real-time estimation of the market's Kolmogorov complexity using Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity on the microstructure data stream. (High MCI = Chaos/Randomness).
    *   **Strategy Complexity Score (SCS):** Analysis of the evolved GP tree's complexity (Node count, Cyclomatic complexity).
*   **Integration:**
    1.  **The Chaos Circuit Breaker:** If MCI spikes, it signals impending chaos, autonomously triggering system-wide risk reduction.
    2.  **Dynamic Parsimony:** The MCI controls the `parsimony_coeff` in the GP engine. (Low MCI forces simpler solutions; High MCI allows complexity).
    3.  **Resonance Deployment:** The system prioritizes deploying strategies whose SCS most closely matches the current MCI.
