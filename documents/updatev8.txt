Okay, I have analyzed all the Python files you provided, assuming the fixes from the previous "System Integration Focus" TODO list have been applied.

Here is the first part of the comprehensive bug hunt TODO list, focusing on critical fixes and inconsistencies:

## üêû Comprehensive Bug Hunt TODO List (Part 1/2)

### 1. Resolve Inconsistent Regime Model Usage (Critical)

* **Issue:** The system trains/loads a predictive HMM (`PredictiveRegimeModel`) but appears to use a dynamic HDBSCAN (`DynamicRegimeModel`) for live predictions in the `ArenaManager`. This means the intended predictive capability isn't being used.
* **Location:** `crucible_engine.py` (`_initialize_regime_models`), `arena_manager.py` (`process_data`).
* **Task:**
    1.  **Standardize:** Choose *one* regime model type for both training/loading and prediction. The predictive HMM (`PredictiveRegimeModel`) aligns better with the goal of anticipating shifts.
    2.  **Modify `CrucibleEngine._initialize_regime_models`**: Ensure it *only* loads/trains `PredictiveRegimeModel` instances and stores them correctly in `self.arena.asset_specific_models[symbol]['regime_model']`. Remove any references to `DynamicRegimeModel` here if present.
    3.  **Modify `ArenaManager.process_data`**: Change the prediction logic to explicitly use the loaded `PredictiveRegimeModel`. Call `regime_model.predict_next_regime_proba(features_for_regime)` or `regime_model.predict(features_for_regime)`. Ensure `features_for_regime` contains *exactly* the features the HMM was trained on (check `PredictiveRegimeModel.feature_columns` after loading). Handle potential errors if features are missing. Pass the resulting `predicted_regime` or probabilities to the agent.

### 2. Prevent Potential Division by Zero Errors

* **Issue:** Several calculations across the codebase involve division without robust checks for zero denominators, risking NaN/inf values or crashes.
* **Locations:**
    * `complexity_manager.py::calculate_lz_complexity`: Division by `np.log2(n)` when `n <= 1`.
    * `backtester.py::calculate_psr`: Division by `psr_denominator`.
    * `agent.py::decide_and_execute`: Division by `sum(vote_counts.values())` for confidence calculation.
    * `microstructure_features_l2.py`: Potential divisions in OFI, VWAP calculations if volumes/spreads are zero.
    * `pit_crew.py::_run_shadow_backtest` (Conceptual): Any metric calculation involving division (Sharpe, profit factor etc.).
    * `watchtower.py::calculate_sharpe_ratio`: Division by `std_dev`.
* **Task:** Review all division operations (`/`) in the listed files (and others like `numba_backtester.py` if available).
    * Add a small epsilon (e.g., `+ 1e-9`) to denominators involving potentially zero values like standard deviation, total volume, or spreads.
    * Alternatively, use an `if denominator != 0:` check (or `if abs(denominator) > 1e-9:`) before dividing, returning a safe default (e.g., 0.0) otherwise.

### 3. Ensure Robust Data Handling Before Model Prediction

* **Issue:** Edge cases might lead to NaN or infinite values in features *after* `FeatureFactory` processing but *before* being fed to models (Agent specialists, RL Governor, Regime model), causing prediction errors.
* **Locations:** `feature_factory.py` (`_process_single_asset` / `create_all_features`), `agent.py` (`decide_and_execute`), `arena_manager.py` (`process_data` before regime prediction).
* **Task:**
    1.  **FeatureFactory Post-Processing:** In `feature_factory.py`, *after* all features (including evolved/GNN) are added, apply a final, robust cleaning step: `df_processed = df_processed.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan).ffill().bfill().fillna(0)`. Log a warning if a large percentage of values were filled.
    2.  **Agent Pre-Prediction Check:** In `agent.py::decide_and_execute`, before calling `model.predict` or `model.predict_proba`, explicitly check the `model_input` DataFrame/Series for `isna().any()` or `isinf().any()`. If problematic values exist, log a warning and skip prediction for that specific model, potentially excluding its vote.
    3.  **Arena Pre-Regime Check:** In `arena_manager.py::process_data`, before calling the regime model prediction, ensure the `features_for_regime` subset doesn't contain NaN/inf values using similar checks as in the agent.

### 4. Fix Agent Execution Quantity Calculation (`agent.py`)

* **Issue:** `Agent._execute_trade` calculates `quantity` based on the `close` price from potentially delayed `latest_features`, which might differ from the actual execution price handled by Cerebellum, leading to incorrect position sizes relative to the intended risk.
* **Location:** `agent.py`, method `_execute_trade`.
* **Task:** Implement one of the following:
    * **Option A (Recommended - Requires Rust change):**
        * Modify `Agent._execute_trade` to calculate the desired *notional value* (e.g., `notional_value = self.virtual_balance * size_fraction`).
        * Modify `CerebellumLink.execute_order` to accept `notional_value` instead of `quantity`.
        * Modify the `CortexCommand::ExecuteOrder` enum in Rust (`protocol.rs`) to include `notional: f64` instead of `quantity: f64`.
        * Modify the Rust execution logic (`exchange.rs::execute_iel` and helpers) to calculate the order quantity based on the `notional` value and the *current* LOB state just before placing the order.
    * **Option B (Python-only workaround):**
        * Inside `Agent._execute_trade`, *before* calculating `quantity`, make an `await self.exchange.fetch_ticker(self.symbol)` call to get the latest `ask` (for buys) or `bid` (for sells) price.
        * Use this fetched price instead of `latest_features['close']` to calculate the `quantity`. Add error handling for the `fetch_ticker` call.

### 5. Address Potential Blocking Calls in Async Loops

* **Issue:** Synchronous file I/O operations within `AgentStateManager` and `ModelRegistry` could potentially block if called very frequently, although they use locks.
* **Location:** `agent_state.py`, `model_registry.py`.
* **Task:** While likely okay for now, monitor performance. If blocking becomes an issue:
    * Refactor the file I/O methods (`_load_states`, `_persist_states`, `_load_manifest`, `_save_manifest`) into separate synchronous functions.
    * In the main class methods (e.g., `save_state`), use `await asyncio.get_running_loop().run_in_executor(None, self._persist_states_sync)` to offload the file writing to a thread pool without blocking the async loop. Ensure the lock (`self._lock`) is still correctly managed around the data access *before* offloading the I/O.

This covers the most critical potential bugs and inconsistencies found. Part 2 will focus on completing unimplemented features and further robustness improvements.
